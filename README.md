# ANALOG-Clock
This project showcases a beautifully designed analog clock created using HTML and CSS. The clock's face and hands are meticulously crafted with HTML elements, while CSS is employed to style and animate them, giving the appearance of a real-time functioning clock. This project highlights my proficiency in web development, particularly in using CSS for positioning, transformations, and animations. It's a testament to my coding skills and creativity in building interactive web components.
